## Synopsis

Machine Learning project for the [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

Still work in progress, testing different kind of regressions.

## Installation

Requirements.txt contains the packages to install with pip. I have only tested it on Python 3, no guarantees it will work for Python 2.

## Project structure

The project can be executed through 'main.py', which imports 'utils.py'.
